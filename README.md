# GAN-for-Generating-MNIST-Fashion-MNIST-with-Keras
In this blog post we'll implement a generative image model that converts random noise into images of digits! The full code is available here, just clone it to your machine and it's ready to play.

For this, we employ Generative Adversarial Network. A GAN consists of two components; a generator which converts random noise into images and a discriminator which tries to distinguish between generated and real images. Here, ‘real’ means that the image came from our training set of images in contrast to the generated fakes.

To train the model we let the discriminator and generator play a game against each other. We first show the discriminator a mixed batch of real images from our training set and of fake images generated by the generator. We then simultaneously optimize the discriminator to answer NO to fake images and YES to real images and optimize the generator to fool the discriminator into believing that the fake images were real.  the generator. With careful optimization both generator and discriminator will improve and the generator will eventually start generating convincing images.

## How to Use the Final Generator Model to Generate Images
Once a final generator model is selected, it can be used in a standalone manner for your application.
This involves first loading the model from file, then using it to generate images. The generation of each image requires a point in the latent space as         input.

## generating an image for a specific point in the latent space
Also You can experiment with generating different points in this space and see what types of numbers they generate.

## Generating digits
We train our GAN using images of digits from the MNIST/Fashion-MNIST dataset.

We also record the accuracy of the discriminator and the loss of the discriminator and the generator after each epoch.
